Lesson 2: Compiling TypeScript
* TypeScript seems interesting and it's like what SASS is to CSS in the following ways:
  * It can't be read by browsers and have to be compiled to readable formats (CSS/JS)
  * This is just an assumption, but it seems like TypeScript is just a "better" way of writing Javascript in that it's more intuitive, like how SASS handles nesting of selectors, maybe TypeScript can make me write in a similarly natural way
* Compiling is pretty straightforward as I used to do it with SASS, too, and I'm pretty sure there's a VS Code extension that allows for automatic compiling anyways

Lesson 3: Type Basics
* Yeah I'm starting to get the importance of TypeScript
* So all this I've been thinking that TypeScript isn't exactly necessary since it's not like I use dynamically-typed variables anyways
* I always use my variables so that they're named properly and serve a specific function, which usually means their types are pretty much set in stone
* With this in mind, I don't really need a more strict way of writing variables so the whole premise of TypeScript is not exactly hooking me in
* But here we are, a solid argument for it, which is when passing parameters to functions
* Setting the types of the parameters when the functions are being written will make it so that every time a function is called, the parameters sent will be checked by the compiler and it doubles as quality checking
* I can't exactly recall running into such issues before to actually paint you a picture, but I vaguely remember encountering them when I was doing my snake game
* Let's see what else TypeScript can do
* Also NaN means Not-a-Number lol didn't know that
