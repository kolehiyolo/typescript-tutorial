Lesson 2: Compiling TypeScript
* TypeScript seems interesting and it's like what SASS is to CSS in the following ways:
  * It can't be read by browsers and have to be compiled to readable formats (CSS/JS)
  * This is just an assumption, but it seems like TypeScript is just a "better" way of writing Javascript in that it's more intuitive, like how SASS handles nesting of selectors, maybe TypeScript can make me write in a similarly natural way
* Compiling is pretty straightforward as I used to do it with SASS, too, and I'm pretty sure there's a VS Code extension that allows for automatic compiling anyways
